Today I finished section 25[^section-25-ref] of the wing manual by installing all of the rivets connecting the nose ribs to the center ribs. I started by dimpling the last remaining hole (the one on the bottom of rib #3) which went very easily after I rounded the corner of the female dimple die a bit more. I then inserted and squeezed the rivets in the remaining holes to completely finish this step.

This was a nice short-and-sweet building evening because I unfortunately caught COVID a week ago and, although I'm feeling pretty good, I'm still a little tired so I decided not to push it.

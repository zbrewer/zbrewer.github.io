I had all day today to work on the plane so I was finally able to finish unpacking everything and taking inventory. There are still a few small parts that I don't have but I'm supposed to receive another shipment of backordered parts from CubCrafters tomorrow so I'll check to see if I receive them then before I contact the factory.

I tried to note where everything was located on the packing slips so that I could find parts more easily while building. For the most part this was just noting what box the parts came in since I typically put everything back. There were, however, a few bundles that I had to re-label with masking tape and some parts that I moved to different boxes so that things I would need together were stored together (such as the wing ribs). This was sometimes a little challenging since it's unclear when many of the parts will be used.

I was able to move most of the parts to the shed but there are still a few pieces in the garage that I'd like to move. Namely these are the ailerons, flaps, stringers, and the spars for the second wing (while I'm working on the first). Most of these have not been moved yet because I need to clear out the shed a bit more first to make a space for them and because I need help moving them. The spars will also likely stay in the garage behind the fuselage (where the ailerons currently are) until I'm ready for them. I also left several of the wing boxes/parts in the workshop intentionally since I will be working with those first. These are mostly stored on the shelf under the workbench.

The video below is the normal timelapse followed by a bit of a tour of the organized parts.

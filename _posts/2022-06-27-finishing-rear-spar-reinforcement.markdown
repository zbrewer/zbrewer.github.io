Craig came by again today to help me finish the rear spar reinforcement on the right wing. We started by pulling all of the rivets in the reinforcement including the countersunk rivet in hole #24. We then match drilled hole #23 with a #40 bit (per the manual) so that we could cleco the pulley bracket in place. With that done, we trimmed the pulley bracket a bit using hand files and a Dremel tool (with a sanding drum) so that it would clear rivets 22 and 24 in the reinforcement strip. Finally, we clamped the pulley bracket in place, match drilled all of the holes with a #30 bit, and then installed the rivets. This finished section 26[^section-26-ref] of the manual. That being said, we do still need to install the top, rear stainless steel rivet for rib #7. This rivet was left out since it interferes with the installation of one of thr rivets in the reinforcement strip. Since that has been installed we are now ready to install the stainless steel rivet as well. I'll do that the next time Craig comes by to help.

Today was a quick day deburring the holes drilled for the rear spar reinforcement so that they would be ready for the rivets to be installed. Almost all of these holes were good and not in need of deburring. I think this was likely because I made sure to stop drilling part-way through the holes to clean chips off the bit/out of the hole. This ensured a cleaner exit.

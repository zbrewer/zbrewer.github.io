Today I started by installing the cap strip on rib #5 per section 31[^section-31-ref] of the manual. This was straightforward and was done as per the previous wing although I was once again sure to clamp a square to the machined tail rib and spar to keep everything square since the false spars are not yet installed. I completed this whole section except for countersinking the hole for the rivet in the nose rib and installing the rivet there.

I also installed the capstrips on ribs #1 and #3 per section 32[^section-32-ref] of the manual. I got them lined up, drilled the holes, deburred, countersunk, and installed the CherryMAX rivets. I still need to drill the holes and install the nutplates to finish this section.

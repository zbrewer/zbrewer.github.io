Today was a short session working on the plane. I got a cold and an ear infection (fortunately not COVID) about a week and a half ago and was still not feeling 100% so I decided to take it easy. The spars needed to be raised about an inch off the sawhorses so that the bottom of the nose ribs (and later the leading edge skins) would clear (since they stick out below the spars). Raising the spars also helps give the flap false spar clearance over the sawhorses as well.

I bought a 2x2" (so actually 1.5x1.5") select pine board from my local hardware store to accomplish this task (I went with a select board so it would be a little smoother and more consistent). I then cut 4 5.5" long sections from it using a reciprocating saw and put one under each end of each spar. I also made sure to put the block on top of the 1" block that was already under the outboard rear spar. Since this raised each corner equally the washout angle (wing twist) should be preserved. I also used some clamps to try to keep everything in place.

Finally, I cleco'd the nose ribs onto the front spar (since I now had clecos available).

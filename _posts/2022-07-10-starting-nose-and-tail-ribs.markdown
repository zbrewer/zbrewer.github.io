Today I worked on installing the nose and tail ribs on the right wing. I finished trimming all of the ribs and used SS/SS42D rivets to install the nose and tail ribs that pair with a center rib to the spars per sections 27[^section-27-ref] and 30[^section-30-ref]. The exception is that I match drilled and riveted the nose and tail ribs to the center rib on rib #8 before installing the SS rivets to the spar. I then installed the remaining SS rivets in that center rib/spar.

After that, I proceeded to match drill, dimple, and rivet the nose ribs to the center ribs. I also match drilled, dimpled, and installed the rivets for the tail ribs on rib #1 and rib #3. Unfortunately, I was out of the necessary rivets at that point so I drilled the side of the remaining (non-double) ribs and installed the rivets there (since the new manual specifies to do this). After that I match drilled and dimpled the top/bottom holes but, as mentioned, didn't have the rivets to install.

After letting the empty shipping crate sit in the driveway for a few days I was finally able to disassemble it today. Martha's parents are in town visiting so her dad, Billy, was able to help me.

We started by adding a panel back to the open end (that I had taken off to remove the fuselage) to stabilize the crate before removing the rest of the side panels. Once that was done we were able to remove the side supports and then the end pieces.

Finally, we turned the bottom "sled" on its side to take it apart.

The crate was held together with a large number of screws, most of which were in good shape. There were a few, however, that were bent and/or had their heads stripped off which made disassembly interesting. A lot of the screws were also hidden by other parts of the crate meaning that the disassembly had to progress in a specific order so we could access everything. The only place we ended up using force was prying the supports off the very top so that we could remove the top panels.

Now that the crate is disassembled and out of the driveway I just need to make a couple fixtures and organize everything before building can begin in earnest.

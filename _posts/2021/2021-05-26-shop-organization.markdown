Today was another quick trip to the shop where Martha and I worked on getting everything a bit more organized and put away. We raised the tail fuselage rotator a bit more to get the plane closer to level and we moved all of the stringers, the ailerons, and the spars under the fuselage to keep them out of the way and protected. In fact, we were able to use the spar holder I build for the sawhorses to hold the right wing spars on either side of the aileron box and make better use of the space. We then moved the wing rack closer to the fuselage to get it out of the way. This created a lot more open floor space than I had before and should work pretty nicely.

We also moved all of the tail feathers (except for the bent horizontal stabilizer that needs to be replaced) to the rafters to get them out of the way. I used some of the foam that the kit was shipped with between the parts to keep them from rubbing. This will keep them much more out of the way and protected than where they previously were leaned up against the wall.

Finally, we re-prepped the temperamental hole in the compression tube that wouldn't fit a rivet and made sure to deburr the back of the hole well. We once again re-assembled everything and tried setting one of the bottom rivets that had been a problem in the past. The stem still wasn't quite flush with the top of the head but, as before, the rivet appears to be tight. I did see a picture from one of the [build-tips threads](http://forum.cubcrafters.com/showthread.php/1791-Chuck-and-Ryan-s-Build-Tips) on the forums where a rivet looked very similar to the rivet I put in. This makes me think that it may have actually been fine the whole time but I'm once again going to try to confirm this with CubCrafters.

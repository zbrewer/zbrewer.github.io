Today I finished taking inventory of the parts shipped in the finish kit and marking them as received on the packing list. I also recorded the box or tote where each item can be found on the packing list (as I did with the other kits) in order to make finding parts easier in the future. This was a lengthy process but I was able to finish it and organize somewhat by moving boxes into the shed. There is still some organizing and rearranging I need to do - especially to get some large items that are still in the garage out of the way.

The finish kit was fun to unpack since there were a lot of neat parts that I'll eventually get to use such as the seats and the brakes. I also received the power distribution kit that I had ordered which included more neat parts like the key and the primer. The power distribution kit didn't come with a packing list but I was able to compare the parts I received to a list of parts I had received in an email when I had inquired about what the kit included. Everything was there and in good condition.

I disassembled the crate that the finish kit was delivered in today as well as the crate I had from when the replacement horizontal stabilizer was delivered. This was pretty similar to disassembling the original crate but these had staples too that made it a bit harder. The wood from the crates is now leaning up against the fence in the driveway while I figure out what to do with it.

I also had the chance to organize the shed a bit more and was able to fit the box with the seats as well as the tires in there (with a lot more room to move around as well). I decided to leave the windshield and the cowling in the garage for the time being but still need to swap the struts and the box with the ailerons when I get a chance and someone to help me.

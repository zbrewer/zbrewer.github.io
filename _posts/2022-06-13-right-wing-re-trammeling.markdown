As I mentioned in the last trammeling entry, I wanted to double-check the right wing a bit more before applying Loctite to anything. When I did, I discovered that the outboard portions of the spars were straight but that the inboard portions both curved forward. I also verified that the #2 compression tube wasn't quite square with the spars. Fortunately, to fix this only the first bay/pair of drag wires had to be adjusted. Craig came by to help me with that and we were able to get that portion fixed pretty quickly. When we were done we re-checked the straightness of the spars, the squareness of the #2 tube, and the tension of the drag wires. Everything was looking good so we test-fit the aileron again which went well.

After the trammeling was complete we installed the diagonal cross-tube in the wing per section 24 of the manual. With that done I also re-installed the center aileron hanger using Loctite and torqued the bolt per section 23[^section-23-ref].

Finally, the manual no longer specifies using Loctite on the drag wire jam nuts but it does mention cutting the drag wires off shorter. I decided to follow the old manual for this step and applied Loctite for all of the jam nuts and left the wires their original lengths. With this complete the right wing is finished through section 24[^section-24-ref].

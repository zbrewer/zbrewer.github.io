My grandfather is in town for a long weekend visit and to help me on the plane! We didn't have a ton of time to work on the build today but we did install the wingtip, landing light, and stall warning horn wires into the bottom front channel of the front spar and secure them with a bit of silicone (ensuring to use neutral cure). This was done in preparation for installing the leading edge skins and per section 44[^section-44-ref] of the manual. We left this to cure overnight but still need to install the ground wire for the stall warning horn (attaches to the spar web) and have decided not to install the pitot/AoA tubing yet as it is done just as easily after the leading edge skins are installed.

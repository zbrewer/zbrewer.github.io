Craig came by again today and we drilled and riveted the spar-side rivets for the leading edge skins. This was a long and tedious process of carefully drilling hole with jig, deburr, install cleco, move on to next. That being said, it was satisfying to complete and gave the skins a lot of extra strength. It also completed section 50[^section-50-ref] of the manual. From there, before calling it a day, I glued the bottom side of the landing light housing as described in section 51[^section-51-ref], paying close attention to not glue the clamps I was using to the landing light housing and also to cleaning up all of the glue that squeezed out.

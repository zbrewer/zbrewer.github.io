Today I finished the installation of the leading edge skins in the left wing per section 49[^section-49-ref] of the manual. This just involved installing the bottom row of rivets although this was a bit of a challenge due to the position of the sawhorse supporting the wing. This went mostly smoothly except for the fact that there is a little bit of slack between the first intermediate rib and rib number one. This should be fine once covered with fabric although it is not quite as tight as it could be. With that skin riveted, I was able to remove all of the clamps and mark the positions to drill for the remainder of the spar side rivets for the leading edge skins.

At this point, I went back and installed the side rivets between the tail ribs and the center ribs per section 27[^section-27-ref] of the new manual. This was not done originally because the old manual did not specify to install them and, when we asked CubCrafters about it, they said to follow what was in the manual. Since the new manual specifies to install them, I went ahead and went back to do this. Fortunately it was a relatively easy fix although I could not find a way to fit a rivet squeezer in to do the bottom of rib #8. This makes sense because the entire rib had to be moved to the side to do this on the other wing. Since the original manual didn't specify to do this and it was obviously okay, I decided to leave this rivet out rather than trying something drastic to install it.

Finally, I taped the landing light housing in place and drilled the holes for the top row of rives per section 51[^section-51-ref]. With these holes drilled, I glued the bottom edge of the landing light housing in place per the directions in the same section. I was extra careful to make sure I wasn't gluing my clamps to the housing and to clean up any excess that squeezed out. I then left this to cure overnight and called it a day.

Relatively small update today. I just went back along the leading edge of the wing and installed rivets in all of the holes Craig and I drilled yesterday. This went pretty smoothly except for the fact that I discovered we missed drilling one hole (the one on the inboard side of the front pulley bracket). I think we missed this one because we wanted to come back to it with the small drilling jig but didn't do so right away in order to minimize drill stop readjustments. Unfortunately, we just missed this one after we switched to the other jig. Everything else went smoothly but we will have to drill this one and install a rivet in order to call section 50[^section-50-ref] officially done.

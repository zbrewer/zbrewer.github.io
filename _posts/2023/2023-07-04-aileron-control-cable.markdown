Today I re-installed the aileron control cable per section 60[^section-60-ref]. This time, I remembered to install the bushing in the inboard pulley and I lightly greased the bolt with lithium grease. I also lightly greased the AN3 bolt holding the outboard pulley cage to the mounting bracket and the pin on which the outboard pulley spins. This time, per CubCrafter's advice, I also torqued the castellated nut to the minimum value and then backed it off, just a little bit, to align the hole in the bolt with the next looser "castellation". This allowed me to still install the cotter pin and keep the bracket nice and snug while also allowing it to pivot (it's still quite tight) just a little bit to achieve initial alignment when tension is applied to the aileron cable.

Today was a quick build session after work where I tightened the fuel tank straps (1-3 threads showing, rather than a torque value). I tried to do this with a crow's foot to hold the bolt head (as recommended by Craig) but I found that it was easier to just re-install the tank strap jig and then tighten. Also, while I was there, I installed the sheet metal screws for the rib #3 braces into the spar, thus completing their install. Finally, I began to pull some parts out for the aileron cable installation but did not actually begin the install. I should note that I had the same experience after tightening the tank straps that Craig did - they cause a very slight twist in the spar. I think this is why the old manual specified to wait to install the rear tank corner nutplates and tail rib rivets until after the tank was installed. As it was, even though I waited on the tail rib rivets, the tank extension skin is a little wavy. Nothing that I think the fabric won't fix although I think the old manual would have turned out a better result here.

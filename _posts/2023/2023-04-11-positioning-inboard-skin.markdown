After a bit of a mixup (I accidentally ordered the leading edge skin for the standard range wing instead of the extended range), I finally have the replacement leading edge skin and some time to work. I kept it simple today and just worked on positioning the skin in a way that I'm happy with in order to avoid another replacement. I decided to do this by aligning the skin with the next one outboard, clamping it in place at the overlap, and then installing the leading edge skin clamps. My rationalle behind this is that the clamps will hold the back side of the skin up against the spar in a way similar to what the rivets will eventually do. In addition, it will hold things firmly in place so there is no gap between the skin and the ribs when drilling and things don't have any opportunity to shift.

With everything in place in a way that I liked, I also attempted to measure the distance frome the bottom edge of the skin back to the spar. I compared this value to the previous wing to make sure they were close and that the new wing was only ever so slightly closer to the spar (some of this slack will be taken up once the window latch doubler is installed). Everything looked good so I think it is ready to drill, although I think I'd still like to have it double checked by Craig before I do.

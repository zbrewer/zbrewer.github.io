Today I drilled the extra fabric rivet holes in the left wing per section 63[^section-63-ref] of the manual. Some of this I had already done (such as through the capstrip on rib #5 and the machined tail rib clips) but I still needed to drill holes along the bottom of rib #3 as well as one extra on a tail rib in the flap bay and one extra on the front of rib #8. The old manual specifies that the flap tail rib holes should also be drilled through the tank extension skin where it sits over the tail ribs but the new manual makes no mention of this. It wouldn't seem to make sense to drill these holes since the extension skin doesn't sit directly on the tail ribs and the new manual makes no mention of these holes. That said, I'd still like to confirm that these don't need to be drilled before calling this section done.

I also managed to install the first two cable fairleads in the right wing today. This is all I was able to do since I ran out of circlips (they didn't seem to send me enough) but this will at least allow installation of the fuel tank in the right wing as soon as it comes back out of the hanger.

Finally, I brought the fuel tank for the left wing in from the shed and unwrapped it. I installed the two pieces of tubing that go over the drag wires per section 58[^section-58-ref] and trimmed them to length. This helped get the fuel tank ready for installation although I still need to measure the drag wires before proceeding.

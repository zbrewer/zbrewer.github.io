Craig came by today and we started the leading edge skins on the right wing per section 49 of the manual[^section-49-ref]. We started by using the drilling template to mark and drill the middle holes in each of the outer nose ribs. After that, we ran a string line between the two holes to mark, and then drill, the holes in the rest of the nose ribs. With that done, we marked the locations of the intermediate ribs on the back of the spar by lining up an adjustable square, held up against the bottom side of the spar cap, with the center of the nose ribs. We then held a block of wood up against the square and the spar webbing and then, without moving the block of wood, moved the square and drew a line down the block.

After all of the nose rib centers were marked we positioned the outboard most skin in place and held it there with tape and velcro straps. At this point, we ran out of time for the night.

The engine and firewall forward kits were delivered a couple weeks ago while I was out of town. Fortunately, Craig was here and was nice enough to receive mine too since our kits were being shipped together to one storage unit that we are going to share. He unloaded the kits and got them into our storage unit but I still needed to do an inventory and compare what I received to the packing slips. Once again, I tried to label the boxes as I did this and, in this case, specify if they were Craig's or mine. I think I was able to find everything and there are just a few parts that were supposed to be included (that weren't back ordered) that were missing. We still need to figure out if we want to do anything else for the engines to store them long-term but it was neat to see them in the storage unit and in person!

I completed a variety of steps on the wings today, skipping around somewhat as I became blocked/unblocked. To start, I tried to align the outboard tail rib along with the machined tail rib brace (in preparation for installing the tail rib) only to discover that the brace doesn't fit when the tail rib is installed. Even with the brace touching the bottom of the cutout in the tail rib, it still can't sit low enough on the machined tail rib to attach to the bottom. Furthermore, when I try to fit the wingtip itself on, the tail rib doesn't line up either. I decided that this is likely a problem with the tail rib itself and that I'll have to come back to it.

Instead, I went ahead and completed section 54[^section-54-ref], trimming the spar tips and the tip of the outboard machined tail rib. This is necessary in order to make sure the wingtip can fit and, after drawing my line, I completed using a die grinder and a metal cutoff wheel. Before trimming the machined tail rib, I temporarily clamped the brace in place (per Craig's suggestion) to prevent it from vibrating during cutting. After the trimming was done, I used some files and sandpaper to clean up any rough edges and make sure there were no remaining burrs. I also test fit the bow tip and, as far as I can tell, it seems like I removed enough material to allow it to fit correctly (although it will still need to be trimmed to sit flat against the outboard most nose rib).

With that done, I installed the final rivets in the tank extension skin, thus completing section 38[^section-38-ref] of the manual. I also added the friction tape to the plastic tubing on the drag wires in the fuel tank bay in order to keep them from moving and finalized the inboard side of the drag wires by applying Loctite and torque seal. Finally, I applied torque seal to the fuel tank strap bolts, completing section 58[^section-58-ref] of the manual.

After that, I installed some friction tape on the pitot/AoA lines where they passed the second drag tube fitting and the jury strut fitting in order to provide a little extra chafe protection in case they begin to rub. I also applied a bit of friction tape and installed a zip tie over top in order to secure the pitot/AoA lines to the drag wire just outside the second drag tube fitting.

Finally, CubCrafters had sent me the missing circlips for the cable fairleads so I finished installing them in the right wing while it was in the stand (per section 60[^section-60-ref]).

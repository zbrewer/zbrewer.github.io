Craig came by again today to help me and together we match drilled all of the holes for the fuel tank extension skin into the rear spar. Once again, we used the drilling jig for this so, other than the fact that it is difficult to fit in a few spots, it was relatively easy and went smoothly. The only way in which this differed from the procedure we followed on the right wing was that I did not match drill or install the rivets from the extension skin into the tail ribs yet. This was a recommendation from Craig since, when he tightened down the fuel tank straps on his first wing, it caused the spar to bend slightly and therefore caused the skin to warp. The initial manual did say to leave these rivets out until after the tank is installed so we're going to try that to see how it works.

While Craig was here, I also got his opinion on the positioning of the inboard leading edge skin and drilled the first two rows of rivets. Finally, after he left, I installed the rivets in the spar for the tank extension skin. This completed section 38[^section-38-ref].

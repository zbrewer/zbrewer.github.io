Craig came by today and helped me drill the remaining rivet holes for the leading edge skins - those into the rear side of the spar cap. This was done per section 50[^section-50-ref] and works well as a two person job so that one person can hold the jig and the other can drill. We started with the fuel tank bay and worked outboard, deburring and installing clecos as we went. Thanks to the fuel tank straps sitting between the spar and the skin, this bay was once again the hardest but the others weren't too bad. We did have to use the custom, small drilling jig again in a few places that the pre-made jig couldn't reach. That being said, this worked well and we got the holes drilled and ready for rivets.

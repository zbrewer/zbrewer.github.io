Today I worked on the nutplates in the fuel tank bay some more. I was able to get both nutplates done on the leading edge side and marked out the position of the rear outboard one. After playing around with the drilling jig some more, I ended up just using the nutplates themselves which worked well again. I now just need to finish the rear nutplates to finish section 57[^section-57-ref].

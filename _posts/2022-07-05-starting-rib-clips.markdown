Today I started installing the machined rib clips per section 29[^section-29-ref] of the manual. I did this in the same way that I did on the right wing except for the fact that the false spars were not yet installed so I clamped a square to the spar and the machined tail ribs to ensure they stayed square throughout the process. I like this order more, however, since any mistakes in the machined tail rib are not as catastrophic at this point.

Today I was able to drill all of the holes for clips in rib #5. Before riveting it in place, I removed the bottom clip and drilled the fabric rivet hole with it on the bench. I then installed the squeezed rivets in these clips. I also drilled the 4 holes (2 each) for the rib #12 clips in the canter rib itself.

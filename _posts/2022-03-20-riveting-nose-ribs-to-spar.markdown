Today my friend Josh came by to help me and I finished installing the nose ribs to the front spar using stainless steel rivets per section 25[^section-25-ref] of the manual. I had already installed most of the bottom rivets but, because of the curve of the nose rib, the top rivets were harder to get to. In order to get around this, I not only used the ground down rivet puller but also a nose piece I ground an angle into so that I could pull the rivets at an angle. This gave me the clearance I needed and Josh held the wing so I could push the puller onto the rivet with a good amount of force.

We installed the rivets in all of the nose ribs except for the nose rib that joins center rib #8. This needs to be drilled and riveted to the center rib on the bottom before the bottom rivets are installed into the spar. Rather than trying to do that today, I opted to wait since Craig is making a new version of his drilling jig that will make drilling the holes in the nose/center ribs easy (hopefully). Drilling, dimpling, and riveting the nose ribs to the center ribs and then pulling the remaining stainless steel rivets in rib #8 are the only remaining parts of this section.

> _Note_: the nose rib on the outboard side of rib #2 (that does not connect to a center rib) can be left out until the false rib is installed on the bottom of rib #2. This provides more space for drilling the holes for the false rib and installing the rivets.

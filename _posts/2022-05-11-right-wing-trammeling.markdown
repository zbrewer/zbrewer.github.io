My grandfather's flight was this afternoon but we decided to give trammeling another shot in the morning before he had to leave. As I mentioned before, the problem we were having is that we could not get the rear spar to remain straight while also keeping the #2 compression tube square to the spars. Today we realized the problem was that the spars were bowing out very slightly around the #2 rib position. We think that is because there is not a rib there to keep the spars at a fixed distance. With that in mind, we were able to get the rear spar very straight between the aileron hangers with just a slight outward bow between the inboard aileron hanger and the wing root. The deflection here is less than 1/8" and (importantly) the compression tube is square. We think that those are the most important parameters so this seems okay but I will double check one more time before applying Loctite.

We did test fit the aileron on the wing and it fit nicely. This gives us additional confidence that it is trammeled correctly.

Finally, we trimmed the diagonal cross tube to prepare for its installation.

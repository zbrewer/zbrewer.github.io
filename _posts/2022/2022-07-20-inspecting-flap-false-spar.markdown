Today I started trying to install the flap false spar per section 37[^section-37-ref] of the manual; however, when I pulled it out of storage I discovered that it had come with a bent corner that I hadn't noticed before. I tried to straighten this out as best as I could but of course was unable to make it perfect. I went ahead an put it in place on the wing but wasn't happy with how it sat and decided that it needs to be replaced. I reached out to CubCrafters for a replacement part and will work on other pieces of the build until I receive one.

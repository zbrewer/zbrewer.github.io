Today I made all 4 wiring harnesses for the wingtip lights (a set of 2 for me and a set of 2 for Craig). These were made in a very similar way to the landing light harnesses except for the fact that I used [M27500-20TG4T14](https://www.wiremasters.net/product/M27500-20TG4T14) 20ga, 4 conductor, shielded wire instead (per suggestions from AeroLEDs). Also, since the outboard shield termination wire is by itself (not part of a bundle), I used 20ga [M22759/16-20-5](https://www.aircraftspruce.com/catalog/elpages/unshieldlwire.php) wire to terminate it per the wire gauge suggestions for unsupported wire in [AC 43.13](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentid/99861). In order to do this I also used some [1/4" solder sleeves](https://www.aircraftspruce.com/catalog/elpages/soldering-sleeves.php) without lead wires pre-inserted. I finished all of these today and therefore all of the custom harnesses for the wings.

Unfortunately, the power went out when I was almost done with the last harness so the timelapse didn't save.

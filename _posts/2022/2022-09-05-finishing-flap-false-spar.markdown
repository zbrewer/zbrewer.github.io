I worked on finishing the flap false spar today. I measured the false rib and determined that it is off center by 1/16" and the distance between the spars is 30 3/8". This means that is is off by about 0.12&deg; I also figured out that there is over 1.5" between the fuel tanks. This seems like such a small angle it will be difficult to notice and there seems like there will be plenty of space in between the fuel tank halves for the false rib to fit.

I confirmed this thinking with Craig and since he, Pete, and Mark all seem to think this will be fine I decided to go ahead and commit to the positioning and drill the holes in the false spar for the #2 tail rib. I also drilled the remaining (bottom) holes in the other tail ribs/the false spar and cleco'd them in place. The only things left to do for section 37[^section-37-ref] of the manual (the flap false spar) are to drill the holes in the flap/aileron hanger, debur all of the holes, and pull the rivets.

Craig came by today and helped me drill the last two holes for now for the flap false spar - the two holes in the center aileron/flap hanger. We drilled these carefully as to not mess up the part and then disassembled the flap false spar to debur it. With that done, we pulled all of the rivets. This finished section 37 of the manual[^section-37-ref]. After that, we put the aileron false spar in place but did not begin drilling any holes yet as we ran out of time.

With Craig's help again, I finished the false spar today by drilling and riveting the remaining holes in the outboard aileron hanger, drilling the remaining holes for the last two ribs (10 and 11), and drilling the holes for all of the tail ribs that do not connect to a main/center rib. With all of the holes drilled, I cleared chips from between the pieces of sheet metal (using a blow gun and a chip chaser, primarily) and then deburred the holes. Finally, I pulled all of the stainless steel rivets using a pneumatic gun. We were unable to get to the center aileron hanger bracket but that is all that is left to do in section 40[^section-40-ref] of the manual.

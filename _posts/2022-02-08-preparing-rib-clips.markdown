# Preparing Rib Clips

The first thing I did today was start to get the rib clips prepared for installation per section 24[^section-24-ref] of the manual. It provides some restrictions about where the holes are supposed to be located but doesn't provide exact positions. In order to meet the requirements given, I marked the clips for the #5 rib so that the holes for the rivets in the center rib will be 9/32" (just over 1/4") from the front edge of the clip and and same distance from the closest side. I also marked the positions of the rivets in the machined tail rib 11/32" (just over 5/16") from the back of the clip and dead center on it.

During this process, I realized that neither the clips for the #5 or the #12 ribs fit over the center ribs. To fix this, I carefully used some files to remove material from the edges of the center ribs until the clips would fit over comfortably. I also cleaned up these filed edges with some 220 grit sandpaper to remove any burrs.

# Preparing Nose Ribs

Based on a tip from Craig, I realized that a lot of the holes in the nose ribs for the stainless steel rivets (the rivets that will attach them to the spars) were drilled slightly undersized and wouldn't fully accept a rivet. I removed the nose ribs, one-at-a-time, to check and drill out the hole with a #30 bit if necessary. I also made sure to cover the clecos in the nose rib on the #8 center rib with tape so that I wouldn't accidentally install the rivets before installing the bottom rivet between the nose and center ribs. With this done, they are ready to be installed per section 25[^section-25-ref].

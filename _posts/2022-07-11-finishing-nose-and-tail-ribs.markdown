Today I finished installing the nose and tail ribs per section 27[^section-27-ref] and 30[^section-30-ref] of the manual. I acquired some more rivets for joining the tail ribs to the center ribs from Craig so I started by squeezing all of those. After that, I installed the rest of the SS/SS42D rivets for the intermediate nose and tail ribs with Martha's help. The exception is that I did not yet rivet nose or tail rib #2 or the intermediate nose rib just outboard of rib #2. This is to allow them to be removed to make drilling the holes for the false rib easier and to provide easier access with the drill/rivet puller. Other than that, these sections are done.

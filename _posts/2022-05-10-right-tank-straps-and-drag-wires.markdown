Yet another productive day today. We installed all of the fuel tank straps (including the felt) and the drag wires. This included the notch in rib#8 for drag wire clearance. We also started trying to trammel (square) the wing but had some trouble getting the rear spar to stay straight and keep the #2 compression tube square to the spars. We decided to give it another shot tomorrow after restarting twice.

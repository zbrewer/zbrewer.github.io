When I installed the jury strut fittings while my grandfather was here I did a couple things that I would not do again. The first of these thing is that I briefly passed a #30 drill bit through the pre-drilled holes. I did this because I didn't think the rivet would go through otherwise. As it turns out (based on Craig's build), the rivets are just a very tight fit but can be made to go through. I also used the offset head on the pneumatic puller instead of the straight head.

I'm not sure which of these ended up being the root cause (or if it was a combination) but both of my just strut fittings had a very small amount of play in them. Craig came by today to help me fix that. We drilled out all of the Cherry max rivets by cutting a shallow notch in the factory head, driving the stem out with an automatic center punch, and then drilling the head off. With that done, we inserted the rivets so that the factory head would be on the fitting side this time (same as the left wing and I had confirmed this was okay with CubCrafters), and then pulled the rivets with the pneumatic puller and the normal head. This worked fine and the fittings no longer have any play.

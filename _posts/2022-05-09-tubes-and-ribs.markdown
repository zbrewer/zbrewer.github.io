Today was another very productive day working on the plane. We started by installing the compression tubes between the two spars and then match drilled and riveted the rest of the fittings onto the spars (including the jury strut fittings). This all went smoothly now that I had done it on a wing before and knew what I was doing. Next, we installed the machined tail ribs, trimmed the #1 double rib to fit, match drilled the holes for the double ribs, and riveted all of the ribs to the spars. We left out the bottom rivets on the #8 rib so that the nose and tail ribs can be installed. We also left out the top rivet on #7 since it needs to be installed after the rear reinforcement strip. All of this went smoothly and we were able to install the first two fuel tank straps before calling it a night.

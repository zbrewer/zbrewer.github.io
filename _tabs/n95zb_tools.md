title: Tools List
---

This is a list of tools that I found valuable during the build. I'll try to keep it updated as I add more tools to my collection during the build process. Cub Crafters does supply a tool list at the beginning of the manual and, while the tools listed there are necessary, I found that they were not completely sufficient. Unless its use is obvious or it is included on the manual's tool list I'll try to provide some context as to where I used the tool and why I found it useful. I'll also try to break out tools that are not strictly necessary but are nice to have into a separate section.

# Tool Suppliers
While some more common tools (such as sockets and screwdrivers) can be bought through more traditional vendors, the following are all good places to buy a variety of aviation specific tools. If in doubt, these are good places to look. In no particular order:
* [Cleaveland Tools](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/)
* [Aircraft Tool Supply](https://aircraft-tool.com/)
* [Yardstore](https://www.yardstore.com/)
* [Brown Tool](https://www.browntool.com/)
* [USATCO](https://www.usatco.com/)
* [Aircraft Spruce](https://www.aircraftspruce.com/) - also good for parts and supplies
* [Stein Air](https://www.steinair.com/) - also good for parts and supplies related to wiring
* [Sky Geek](https://skygeek.com/) - also good for parts and supplies

# Cleaveland Tool Kit
This is a kit put together by [Cleaveland Tools](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/) that includes some of the basic aircraft tools needed for construction. You can email them for pricing and to order it since (at least when I ordered mine) it wasn't listed on their website. You can source all of the tools separately if you wish (might be a little cheaper) but it saves some time to order the kit and their quality/customer service is good. I should note that I did make the following 3 upgrades to the kit (they gave me a bit of a discount for including them in the kit instead of ordering separately):
* I added the [Nova 4000 RPM palm drill](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/drilling-and-deburring/products/4000rpm-nova-palm-drill) to my kit. This is a fantastic tool for drilling aluminum, especially the smaller #30 and #40 holes. It is also a lot more comfortable to use than a cordless drill and fits into tight areas better. It is very easy to finely control the RPM and operates very smoothly. One of my favorite tools overall and highly recommend.
* I also added the [deluxe air hose and manifold block kit](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/pneumatic-accessories/products/deluxe-airhose-and-manifold-block-kit) to my order. This includes some lightweight hoses and a manifold so you can keep several air tools hooked up at once. This is great so that you can leave the drill, rivet puller, and blow gun hooked up and avoid constantly disconnecting to swap between them. The air hoses and (critically) the quick disconnects are also very small/light which really helps with the tool weight and the ability to fit the tools into tight places. Another option is to just purchase a single [lightweight hose kit](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/pneumatic-accessories/products/lightweight-airhose-kit) if the benefit of a lightweight hose sounds good to you but you don't mind swapping tools.
* Finally, I upgraded the squeezer to "[The Main Squeeze](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/squeezers-and-yokes/products/main-squeeze-model-22)". This is a squeezer made by Cleaveland that provides a little more leverage. There aren't that many squeezed rivets or dimples in the build so it isn't necessary but it is a very nice squeezer and I thought it was worth it. That being said, a pneumatic squeezer definitely isn't necessary for most people.

## Kit Contents
If you decide not to buy the kit, here are the tools that came in mine that you should buy separately:
* [Nova 4000 RPM palm drill, 1/4" chuck and key](https://www.panamericantool.com/novar-compact-pistol-grip-drill.html) (see above, highly recommended).
* Rivet squeezer that takes pneumatic yokes such as [The Main Squeeze](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/squeezers-and-yokes/products/main-squeeze-model-22) or the [Avery squeezer](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/squeezers-and-yokes/products/avery-hand-squeezer-handle-only).
* [2" yoke](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/squeezers-and-yokes/products/2-pneumatic-yoke) for the rivet squeezer.
* [2.5" flange nose yoke](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/squeezers-and-yokes/products/25-flange-nose-pneu-yoke) for the rivet squeezer.
* [Dimple die set](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/countersinking-and-dimpling/products/dimple-die-set-for-3_32-rivet) including at least a 3/32" male die, a small diameter 3/32" female die, a 1/8" male die, and a small diameter 1/8" female die.
* [Flat rivet squeezer set](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/riveting-and-bucking/products/flat-squeezer-sets) including a 1/8" x 1/2" set, a 1/8" x 3/8" set, and a 1/2" x 3/8" set.
* [Cup squeezer set](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/riveting-and-bucking/products/squeezer-cup-set) including a 3/32" cup and a thin 1/8" cup.
* [Micro Stop countersink cage](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/countersinking-and-dimpling/products/micro-stop-countersink-cage-with-needle-bearings-and-nylon-foot) (nylon foot is nice to have but not necessary).
* [Countersink cutters](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/countersinking-and-dimpling/products/countersink-cutter-3-32-rivet) for 3/32" and 1/8" rivets (one each).
* [Speed deburring tool](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/drilling-and-deburring/products/speed-debur-and-countersink-set).
* [Drill set numbers 1-60](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/drilling-and-deburring/products/drill-set-numbers-1-60). While not strictly required (you could buy the individual bits you need) it is very handy to have odd sizes accessible when you need them. This also prevents you from having to scour the manual to find all of the odd sizes that you only use once or twice.
* [#3 Unibit (step drill)](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/drilling-and-deburring/products/3-unibit-1_4-3_4-x-16ths).
* [#30 cobalt jobber length bits](https://aircraft-tool.com/shop/detail.aspx?id=012-12K-30). You'll go through a lot so it's worth getting a pack of 12 or 2. It's nice to have extra bits on hand so you don't feel bad swapping to a new one as soon as the one you've been using starts to get a little dull.
* [#40 cobalt jobber length bits](https://aircraft-tool.com/shop/detail.aspx?id=012-12K-40). I didn't go through these quite as quickly but a 12 pack is probably still worth it.
* [12" #30 cobalt bits](https://www.panamericantool.com/cobalt-aircraft-extension-drills-wire-sizes-12-overall-length.html). You'll use a number of the 12" bits as well.
* [12" #40 cobalt bits](https://www.panamericantool.com/cobalt-aircraft-extension-drills-wire-sizes-12-overall-length.html).
* [6" #30 cobalt bits](https://www.panamericantool.com/cobalt-aircraft-extension-drills-wire-sizes-6-overall-length.html). The kit comes with 6" bits although I find that I don't use them as often as the jobber or 12" bits. Normally if the jobber bit doesn't fit the flexibility/extra length of the 12" bit is appreciated. That being said, there are a couple places where 6" is long enough and the extra stability over a 12" bit is appreciated so it's worth picking up a couple.
* [6" #40 cobalt bits](https://www.panamericantool.com/cobalt-aircraft-extension-drills-wire-sizes-6-overall-length.html).
* [6" 3/16" cobalt bits](https://www.panamericantool.com/cobalt-aircraft-extension-drills-fractional-sizes-6-overall-length.html). The tool kit comes with one 12" bit; however, these are used in the wings for drilling out the drag wire holes and I found that 6" bits are plenty long. In fact, they do a better job since they don't flex as much and therefore don't bind. I used one bit for each wing so you'll likely want at least two. You could maybe get by with one but the bit dulls a fair amount over the course of one wing.
* [Reamers](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/drilling-and-deburring/products/30-straight-flute-reamer). The kit comes with a 1/4", a 5/16", and a 3/8" reamer but there are some additional sizes that are useful (see below).
* [CDI 1501MRMH 1/4" Drive Torque Wrench, 20-150 in/lbs](https://www.amazon.com/CDI-1501MRMH-4-Inch-150-Pound-Capacity/dp/B000KL4HZ8).
* [Cleco pliers](https://aircraft-tool.com/shop/detail.aspx?id=131).
* [3/32" clecos](https://aircraft-tool.com/shop/detail.aspx?id=25CL-3%2f32). The kit comes with a bag of 25 which generally seems to be enough.
* [1/8" clecos](https://aircraft-tool.com/shop/detail.aspx?id=25CL-1%2f8). The kit comes with a bag of 25. There are times where more (50+) would be useful so it wouldn't hurt to pick up some extras.
* [3/16" clecos](https://aircraft-tool.com/shop/detail.aspx?id=CL-3%2f16). The kit comes with a bag of 10. That's probably enough.
* [Pneumatic blind rivet puller](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/collections/riveting-and-bucking/products/pneumatic-pop-rivet-puller) This is optional if you aren't buying the tool kit and you could always buy a cheaper one in its place. That being said, it is nice to have a pneumatic puller for some of the sections with a lot of rivets, such as the fabric rivets in the wings.

# Basic Tools
There are a number of other tools, in addition to those mentioned in the kit above, that I would consider either necessary or extremely useful for the build.
* [Extra drill bits](https://www.panamericantool.com/cobalt-aircraft-drills-wire-gauge-number-sizes.html). I mentioned this briefly in the above section about the tool kit but you'll go through plenty of bits during the build so it is worth while to have extras on hand. In addition to not having to slow down to wait for new bits to be delivered, it help avoid the temptation to keep using a bit that is starting to get dull. The split point cobalt bits do work better and last longer so they are worth the extra cost. Pan American Tool Corporation makes my favorite bits but others work as well. The 12 packs from Aircraft Tool Supply are a good deal, especially for common bit sizes like #30 and #40 (I think they're actually Pan American bits anyway). Jobber length bits are the most used but some of the longer bits have their place as well. The following are the most useful to buy/keep on hand:
    * [#30 cobalt jobber length bits](https://aircraft-tool.com/shop/detail.aspx?id=012-12K-30).
    * [#40 cobalt jobber length bits](https://aircraft-tool.com/shop/detail.aspx?id=012-12K-40). I didn't go through these quite as quickly but a 12 pack is probably still worth it.
    * [12" #30 cobalt bits](https://www.panamericantool.com/cobalt-aircraft-extension-drills-wire-sizes-12-overall-length.html). You'll use a number of the 12" bits as well.
    * [12" #40 cobalt bits](https://www.panamericantool.com/cobalt-aircraft-extension-drills-wire-sizes-12-overall-length.html).
    * [#55 cobalt jobber length bits](https://www.aircraft-tool.com/shop/detail.aspx?PRODUCT_ID=012-12K-55). These are optional but highly recommended since I found them to be the perfect size for drilling pilot holes. Drill bits have a tendency to walk when starting a hole with a larger size (#30 or #40), even when using a split point bit and a center punch to create a starting point. #55 bits are much easier to control and stay in the punched position very well. The holes can then be enlarged with much less of a tendency for the bits to wander.

# Electrical Tools
If you will be doing any of your own wiring then there are some electrical tools that you will need. These are the tools I found useful but your needs may differ depending on the extent of the electrical work you will be doing.

# Optional/Quality of Life Tools
These tools aren't strictly necessary since the build can be completed without them. That being said, they make certain steps easier and improve the build experience. I generally recommend them but you can pick-and-choose what makes the most sense to you.

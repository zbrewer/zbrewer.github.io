Source for my personal website. Build using Jekyll and deployed on GitHub Sites.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Follow the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of `Ruby`, `RubyGems`, `Jekyll`, and `Bundler`.

### Running Local Server

Test changes before pushing by running locally with the following command:

```console
$ bundle exec jekyll s
```

The preview will then be available at _<http://localhost:4000>_.

### Deploying Changes

Changes pushed to the `main` branch are automatically deployed.

### Updating JavaScript

Changes to the JavaScript source must be re-minified using gulp. First install NodeJS and NPM using the instructions for your OS (if they are not already installed). Then install the necessary packages with the following command (from the project directory):

```console
$ npm install gulp gulp-concat gulp-rename gulp-uglify gulp-insert fs
```

The JavaScript files can then be regenerated by running the `gulp` command from the project directory.

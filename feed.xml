This time, I remembered to install the bushing in the inboard pulley and I lightly greased the bolt with lithium grease. I also lightly greased the AN3 bolt holding the outboard pulley cage to the mounting bracket and the pin on which the outboard pulley spins. This time, per CubCrafter’s advice, I also torqued the castellated nut ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Outboard Tail Rib</title><link href="https://zbrewer.com/posts/outboard-tail-rib/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Outboard Tail Rib" /><published>2023-06-24T12:00:00-06:00</published> <updated>2023-06-24T12:00:00-06:00</updated> <id>https://zbrewer.com/posts/outboard-tail-rib/</id> <content src="https://zbrewer.com/posts/outboard-tail-rib/" /> <author> <name>Zach Brewer</name> </author> <category term="Carbon Cub Build" /> <category term="Wings" /> <category term="Left Wing" /> <summary> Today I was able to get the outboard tail rib installed per section 53 of the manual1. This had turned out to be a bit of a challenge because, before installing the tail rib, I test fit it with the diagonal cross brace (tension brace between the machined tail rib and the outboard spar tip that passes through the outboard tail rib) and realized that the cross brace wouldn’t line up with the cuto... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Stall Warning Cutout</title><link href="https://zbrewer.com/posts/stall-warning-cutout/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stall Warning Cutout" /><published>2023-06-11T12:00:00-06:00</published> <updated>2023-06-11T12:00:00-06:00</updated> <id>https://zbrewer.com/posts/stall-warning-cutout/</id> <content src="https://zbrewer.com/posts/stall-warning-cutout/" /> <author> <name>Zach Brewer</name> </author> <category term="Carbon Cub Build" /> <category term="Wings" /> <category term="Left Wing" /> <summary> The first thing I did today was cut out the leading edge skin for the stall warning horn per section 591 of the manual. After marking the position in Sharpie with the template provided, I drew an “X” through the large center hole and used a #30 bit to drill out the center. This gave me a pilot hole so I didn’t have to worry about the stepped bit walking on the curved surface. With that done, I ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Taking Inventory of the Engine and Firewall Forward Kit</title><link href="https://zbrewer.com/posts/engine-and-fwf-inventory/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Taking Inventory of the Engine and Firewall Forward Kit" /><published>2023-06-10T12:00:00-06:00</published> <updated>2023-06-10T12:00:00-06:00</updated> <id>https://zbrewer.com/posts/engine-and-fwf-inventory/</id> <content src="https://zbrewer.com/posts/engine-and-fwf-inventory/" /> <author> <name>Zach Brewer</name> </author> <category term="Carbon Cub Build" /> <category term="Logistics" /> <summary> The engine and firewall forward kits were delivered a couple weeks ago while I was out of town. Fortunately, Craig was here and was nice enough to receive mine too since our kits were being shipped together to one storage unit that we are going to share. He unloaded the kits and got them into our storage unit but I still needed to do an inventory and compare what I received to the packing slips... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Trimming the Left Wing Spar Tips</title><link href="https://zbrewer.com/posts/trimming-spar-tips/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trimming the Left Wing Spar Tips" /><published>2023-06-04T12:00:00-06:00</published> <updated>2023-06-04T12:00:00-06:00</updated> <id>https://zbrewer.com/posts/trimming-spar-tips/</id> <content src="https://zbrewer.com/posts/trimming-spar-tips/" /> <author> <name>Zach Brewer</name> </author> <category term="Carbon Cub Build" /> <category term="Wings" /> <category term="Left Wing" /> <summary> I completed a variety of steps on the wings today, skipping around somewhat as I became blocked/unblocked. To start, I tried to align the outboard tail rib along with the machined tail rib brace (in preparation for installing the tail rib) only to discover that the brace doesn’t fit when the tail rib is installed. Even with the brace touching the bottom of the cutout in the tail rib, it still c... </summary> </entry> </feed>
